# phm2021_data_challenge

database implementation for the N-CMAPSS dataset that uses the same schema as the [uav project](https://github.com/darrahts/uavTestbed) (with some improvements) with a python api. 

Work in progress, should have the api finished on oct 10th, and short [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/darrahts/phm2021_data_challenge/blob/main/notebooks/data_loading_api_examples.ipynb) that will input all of the data into the database.
